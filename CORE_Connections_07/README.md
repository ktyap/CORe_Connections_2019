If you are not aware of any specific applications and wish to search about an industry of interest to you, be on the lookout for recent articles about "big data". You may instead choose to draw from personal experience if you’ve worked for a company that uses analytics (but please make sure to not disclose confidential or proprietary information).

The story I wish to share is regarding _dynamic pricing_ or _surge pricing_ used by companies, such as that used by ride-hailing company Uber. This article explains the idea behind dynamic pricing ([Government Technology, 2016](https://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Dynamic-Pricing-Is-Catching-On-in-the-Public-and-Private-Sectors.html)). Essentially, dynamic pricing is based on the simple logic of supply and demand - if supply increases, the price should come down; and if the supply decreases, the price should go up. 

Uber has been able to make use of this logic to create a surge pricing policy. Technology (smartphones and apps) makes this possible that Uber can have access to real time demand (number of requests sent by customers) and real time supply (number of nearby drivers) as well as historical data of supply and demand (for example, time of day, weekends and public holidays), which allows Uber to create a dynamic or surge pricing algorithm. This use of data is very compelling for a company like Uber, since it allows Uber to set higher prices (and possibly leads to higher revenue) and also encourages more drivers to alleviate supply shortages when the demand is high. The customers should, ideally, also benefit since it could alleviate supply issues.

However, as a side-thought, the surge pricing of Uber or any ride-hailing companies is quite controversial because it can allow Uber to engage in price-gouging practices. For example, dynamic pricing can allow Uber to inflate its prices in markets where it has a dominant market share (price gouging can occur for at least a period of time, until an alternative or a competition emerges). It can also happen if the few dominant market players in certain markets conspire to price gouging (again, at least for a period of time, until “_true_” competitions arrive).
