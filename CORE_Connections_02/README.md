##### Instructions:

Sometimes the more expensive product wins since higher customer willingness to pay more than offsets the higher price. For example, Starbucks' market share exceeds that of nearly every rival, despite higher prices. Choose and describe two products that compete in the same market where the more expensive product has a higher market share. What features of the more expensive product result in the higher willingness to pay? 

Upload a photo of both products and/or company logos. NOTE--If using two pictures, you must combine them into a single image file for upload. You can use an image editing program, a screen grab or snip, or even Microsoft PowerPoint (place the pictures next to each other and save the slide in JPG or PNG format). 

If the images are not your own, be sure to cite your sources in your description.

##### Shared:

This example is based on a statistics on the ranking of the most used vacuum cleaner brands in the UK in [2017](https://www.statista.com/statistics/437720/leading-brands-of-vacuum-cleaners-in-the-uk/). This should be a good representation of the market share of household vacuum cleaner brands in the UK. Dyson owned the largest market share in 2017 (14.5 million units), a private-owned company known for its innovative bagless vacuum cleaner first sold in the 1980s. The closest competitor was Vax (a distant second at 5.6 million units), another UK brand, now owned by the parent company Techtronic Industries headquartered in Hong Kong.

Dyson’s vacuum cleaners carry hefty price tags - its cordless vacuum cleaners range from 250 pounds to 599 pounds, compared to Vax’s models priced from 180 pounds to 250 pounds. Vax’s pricing is consistent with the rest of the competing brands.

Dyson is able to command such high prices because a lot of users have very high willingness to pay for its products. Dyson, both the company and its founder James Dyson, have addressed a major pain-point of vacuum cleaner users (that before the invention of its bagless vacuum cleaner, a bagged vacuum cleaner would quickly lose suction with just a thin layer of dust build up), and have correctly predicted that users would pay a high price to have this feature. Another consideration that it does not require a bag helps to offset the lifetime cost of ownership. Even though its competitors now have similar features (bagless, high suction, etc), Dyson continues to command a leading market share position, and at the same time retaining its very high price premium over its competitors. This may be in part due to the image and success story of Dyson as a leading innovator and a premium brand. This is helped by the fact that Dyson has over the years continue to innovate and create innovative products such as airblade hand dryers, bladeless fans and hairdryers - these products all differentiate themselves from the markets they compete in with unique features. 

It short, Dyson is able to continue to command high willingness to pay because of the premium and innovative brand image, (still) leading/competitive product features and brand loyalty.
