My example is TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. TD Ameritrade Futures & Forex LLC (TDAFF) provides futures and foreign exchange trade execution services to its clients. Futures, and futures contracts, allow tradings to happen at a price of the underlying asset of commodity ([Investopedia, 2019](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp)). 

According to TDAFF’s Statement of Financial Condition and Supplemental Information dated September 30, 2018, the company held about 18% cash and cash equivalents of its total assets worth $500.8 million, defined as temporary and highly-liquid investments with short maturity dates of three months or less. But what caught my eye was the very high next line of account named “_cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes_”, making up about 60% of its total assets, defined in the same financial report as “_cash and investments segregated as on deposit for regulatory purposes consists of cash deposits and U.S. Treasury securities that have been segregated or secured for the benefit of futures clients_”, as regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The very high amount in its highly liquid “_cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes_” is a result of regulatory requirements, nonetheless relates to its normal operation of futures trading. Liquidity is a measure of how quickly and easily an asset can be converted to cash.

The other current assets included receivables from various entities which are all very liquid. Lastly, the non-current assets included goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other assets, came to about 13% of its total assets.
