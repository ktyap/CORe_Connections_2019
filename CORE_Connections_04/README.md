##### Instructions:

Describe two products or services that are "complements" - other than the ones that are described in the course. Share a photo illustrating those two products or services (Be as creative as possible in your posts!) 

NOTE--If using two pictures, you must combine them into a single image file for upload. You can use an image editing program, a screen grab or snip, or even Microsoft PowerPoint (place the pictures next to each other and save the slide in JPG or PNG format). 

If the images are not your own, be sure to cite your sources in your description.

##### Shared:

Two of the Walt Disney Company’s current most popular products are the Marvel Cinematic Universe series of movies and Disneyland Resorts/Parks. The two products are complementary to each other, as interests in one generally lead to interests in the other and vice versa - a customer (perhaps more so for a younger person) who goes to watch a Marvel Studio movie can be expected to be reasonably interested to visit a Disneyland Park or Resort because of related attractions to Marvel, and vice versa. 

Disney currently has plans for new Marvel-themed lands for Walt Disney Studios in Paris in 2020, Walt Disney World in Florida in 2021, and Disneyland in Hong Kong in 2023 ([People.com, 2019](https://people.com/travel/disneyland-proposes-plans-marvel-land/)). More Marvel Cinematic Universe movies are also being planned and filmed for the next few years.

There is an upcoming third product that is complementary to both the above products. Disney also announced an upcoming direct-to-customer streaming service, Disney+, scheduled to launch in late 2019 in the US ([Walt Disney Company, 2018](https://dtcimedia.disney.com/news/star-wars-marvel-series-announced-for-disney-plus)).

Note: The current example would be more general if we categorize the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies as “movie production” since the Walt Disney Company also owns other studios and well-known brands such as Star Wars.
