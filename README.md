#### HBS Online Credential of Readiness - CORe Connections 2019

This is a repository for my CORe Connections sharing for the [Credential of Readiness program, HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/courses/core/), which I attended from June - September 2019. CORe (Credential of Readiness) is a 150-hour certificate program on the fundamentals of business from Harvard Business School. CORe is comprised of three courses—Business Analytics, Economics for Managers, and Financial Accounting—developed by leading Harvard Business School faculty and delivered in an active learning environment based on the HBS signature case-based learning model.

CORe Connections is a series of weekly sharing among peers based on certain topics learned throughout the CORe program. All entries are as-submitted as part of the requirements to pass CORe.
